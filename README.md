# Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their behavior and attributes. The goal is to help companies reduce churn by identifying at-risk customers early.

## ⚙ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 Project Steps
- Loaded and cleaned the telecom churn dataset
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized customer trends and key factors
- Built models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## 📈 Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: *84%*
- Random Forest Accuracy: *87%*
- Key churn factors: Monthly charges, Tenure, Contract type
